## Overview
Tyndale University is a Christian university in Toronto offering a wide range of programs at the undergraduate, seminary & graduate levels. Tyndale's Bachelor of Education (BEd) program is a unique program that accelerates the process to become a certified teacher in Ontario over 16 consecutive months.

This website design project was completed in 4 months in collaboration with Tyndale University’s web manager and stakeholders including the Admissions and Bachelor of Education department.

### Organization
Tyndale University

### Purpose of the Redesign and Goal
The Bachelor of Education is a unique program among all other Bachelor programs at Tyndale University. There was a need for a website redesign for all sections with a main priority to lead with a story on the main home page.

## Research and Strategy
The first step was to audit the web section including the home page and sub-links such as the different program tracks, information about tuition, application information and information sessions. This includes creating a plan for new URL paths and redirects.

Using Drupal as a Content Management System, it was important to organize the different Content Types, Views and Blocks that will be used to communicate with the web developer and web manager.
