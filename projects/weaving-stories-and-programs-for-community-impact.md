This website design project was completed in 6 months in collaboration with the Communications Team and Operations Director at Toronto City Mission (TCM) to enhance the organization’s offerings and community programs with kids and teens.

## Organization
Founded in 1879, Toronto City Mission is Toronto’s oldest continuous outreach serving people impacted by poverty. Rooted in Christian faith, it focuses today on long-term transformation through relationship-based programs for children, youth, and families in underserved communities.

The organization continues to provide diverse programs including: Sonshine Day Camp, Kids in Community (KIC), Education Provided in Community (EPIC), Youth Extreme (YX), Teens Leading Communities (TLC), and Role Model Moms (RMM).

## Purpose of the Redesign

The website redesign aims to unify stories, testimonies, and program outcomes into a clear, connected narrative while improving site architecture through parent–child page relationships and a tighter content taxonomy.

By enhancing a Squarespace template with JavaScript and redesigning the homepage with dynamic blog and event content, the project strengthens calls to action to improve program visibility and increase enrolment.
