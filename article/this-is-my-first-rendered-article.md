This is a milestone for sticking through and building a working web page application that renders out markdown files into content that lives on a website.

This is a second paragraph to see if the writing from Decap CMS gets rendered to the server.

I am realizing that every time i add or update an existing article, i need to republish it.

It goes back to the draft status after saving with the update content, then i manually have to publish it again, after setting the status to Ready.

This is my final message for tonight - confirming that the updates I make on Decap CMS get rendered to the production site properly in a continuous fashion - based on the configuration set up using Netlify and Github.
