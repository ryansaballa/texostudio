                <h1>Hello, my name is Ryan!</h1>
                <p>I'm a web specialist building web content and code for CIRO - Canada's regulator protecting investors and capital markets.</p>
                <p>This is my basecamp on the internet. Thanks for dropping by! I've put a short story about myself if you would like to read on below.</p>

                    <h2>YYZ</h2>
                    <p>A little background - I am born and raised in Toronto and have never left the city. Growing up I wanted to be an architect and after discovering graphic design, wireframing and coding, I have been on this path of exploring the web. Instead of learning the tools to design city buildings and structures, I have equipped myself to learn semantic HTML, CSS and JavaScript to build websites.</p>
                    <p>That said, I do appreciate city architecture and have curated photos overtime in my wanderings in Toronto and outside the city with my Fujifilm x100F.</p>

                    <h2>Long Life Learning</h2>
                    <p>I thought university was about learning as much to then land the perfect career role. Instead I can only look back to one of my favourite courses (ITM740) where I was tasked to create wireframes and a prototype for a restaurant-booking mobile app. Creating pitchdecks and collaborating with other students for this project was an unforgettable experience.</p>
                    <p>A recording of the prototype made from Adobe XD still lives on the web, <a href="">watch the video</a>.</p>
                    <p>After graduation, I've taken more courses related to research, web design and development and continue to create <a href="">projects</a> to apply what I have learned over the years.</p>

                    <h2>Frontend Development</h2>
                    <p>At the core - I am always looking to learn more about the tools to serve others on the web. I have discovered the growing demand for websites, the maintenance that comes with content management systems and appreciate web building platforms, but I have grown more curious about the engine under the hood and look to learn more about front-end development.</p>
