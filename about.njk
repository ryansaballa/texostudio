                <h1>Hey there, my name is Ryan! &#x1F44B;</h1>
                <p>I'm a web specialist building web content and code for CIRO - Canada's own regulator for protecting capital markets and investors.</p>
                <p>This is my basecamp on the internet. Thanks for dropping by! I have put a short story about myself if you would like to read on below.</p>

                    <h2>YYZ</h2>
                    <p>A little background - I am born and raised in Toronto and have never moved out of the city.</p>
                    <p>Growing up, I wanted to be an architect but after discovering graphic design, wireframing tools and code, I have been exploring the web. Instead of learning the tools to design city buildings and structures, I'm learning front end tools like semantic HTML, CSS, JavaScript and React to build websites and applications.</p>
                    <p>With that said - I do appreciate city architecture and have curated photos overtime in my wanderings in Toronto and outside the city with my Fujifilm x100F.</p>

                    <h2>Long Life Learning</h2>
                    <p>I thought university was about learning as much to then land the perfect career role. Instead I can only look back to one of my favourite courses (ITM740) where I was tasked to create wireframes and a prototype for a restaurant-booking mobile app. Creating pitchdecks and collaborating with other students for this project was an unforgettable experience.</p>
                    <p>A recording of the prototype made from Adobe XD still lives on the web, <a href="https://vimeo.com/265436593?turnstile=0.CZ0dozmqVVwN_pstsOBj3qmVRPuSbLk81ioq5dyGRH_hpEsp43rDay_tRq7yaZYVj-q60ecOl94h6ObNuoni5pPibjp-yKWvFiByhc_yuTC2kKOcFvs4iFtQrLdaZjJd6VTvHtJia7RAwF2T6vccHdxngN21ioFPAzZXv2cteCtlTedjafOXNmv1FEC6XDRcqqU92EMXhG_EuFO1e3gBde-UHFOxb0TS1SjYz4uCzEE97MLUsQJksoSjqCnW24K2t85sDZyPwJESlFhM5F0oz3tG7Du9EeLOAle5keY9dLiOiniJsTHEvkXTBPLJljGlGk1lE-MQsqG45QOh1AOR68VltLLQapLdYNkD0Q1nvz-SpUGseF5IJlN3UTYx-HrOSKqF7UXocBlC65T09_7MlYE_A-Rirv_WMd64NCz0Fl3gpy5A7QRdr7BRt-3lVcDbxaDUWORE7J726kkyxhPJMTeFwiTx4fDti5qHd-J239KujlVzw1s4-3WzZYpJmoBFnXu9iEB_YhgtCpWJ12-0RxWPtMH9n8NH_4c1ktyU3d2cpu4ngZ0rTvS6Jj-5v0VOLxKE8Gs3IZvIZ2F5XoaDZ9k38zU91P0Rr6N8XFEqpca5wPhAi9aA6bgBK2NNZnZHooMCpcFN_kyDfqj4UtTFK8X9rylt32LWJbyPFPPJ9AeTGWkrXBJM8w_Kg3eDF-XU4uF5sKQ6ccQj7HQHfADBf4Zopgb8WHy-u6wuzPf6gvhxbXZ_ig9_wdG6GYGlVm4uvkC_0x1JsyGZco73syyie2UeVY2bnXbm6JcOwWiwLrd5H_lMG0LkiCz69AiKRoEMuY37VTxrQek9AlY6pIkQdMbknmDuqROzwbOOeA-HC-5-v05ugM-otzHxmOuqOotv.PPoDVdQAJ0LdgbUedjLjcg.9ad6163023b63eb4a86f2668c8507c06146501bb0a85dd50458f51096fff451d" alt="Video of Mobile Application on Vimeo">watch the video</a>.</p>

                    <h2>Frontend Development</h2>
                    <p>At the core - I am always looking to learn more about the tools to serve others on the web. I have discovered the growing demand for building websites, the maintenance that comes with it and the art of using website builders. With that discovery, I have grown more curious about the engine under the hood and look to learn more about front-end development.</p>
                    <p>I've taken more courses related to research, web design and development and continue to create <a href="">projects</a> to apply what I have learned over the years.</p>
